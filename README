This group of matlab programs is setup to run shock impedance matching for a three material shock experiment.
The program is time and space agnostic and only follows the shock wave reverberating through the target.
The program is set up with several preset materials, and allows the user to write their own model.
The Impedance matching method is based on a number of assumptions/simplifications which make the method quick and easy.
The two most important assumptions are:
  1) The material releases along the hugoniot
  2) Materials behave hydrodynamicaly (inelasticaly)
      A material can be set up for perfect elasticity be setting C0=CL and s=0
These make the method inaccurate, but it can be a good approximation.

The impedance matching method is based on first principles: the conservation of mass and linear momentum,
More information about this method can be found in Jerry W. Forbes, "Shock Wave Compression of Condensed Matter", chapter 3.
An explainaition of the method can be found in Dr. John Borg's Shock Physics Class.
The preset hugoniot models are from Marc A. Meyers, "Dynamic Behavior of Materials", page 133.
